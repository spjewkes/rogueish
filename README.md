# Rogueish

This is a simple roguelike development using Python. The idea is something to tinker with over time and it is currently not expected to be in any sort of playable form.

The development started by me looking at the tutorials [here|https://nightblade9.github.io/python-zone/2018/creating-a-roguelike-in-python-tdl-part-1.html]. It currently uses TDL although this should be changed at some point as this is consider legacy.
